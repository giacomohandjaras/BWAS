<i>external_code:</i> external libraries (e.g., fdr_bh.m, export_fig, etc...) used to perform analyses<br><br>
<i>code:</i> our set of functions to simulate data, calculate power, type M and S errors, replication rate<br><br>
<i>derivatives:</i> the folder with figures and workspaces generated by the parent scripts<br><br>
<i>raw_data:</i> raw materials, downloaded from source figures of the original M&TC paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04492-9)<br><br>
<i>manuscript:</i> current version of our manuscript<br><br>
<i>simulation_parent_script.m:</i> code to perform statistical measures between rsFC components and cognition, as well as ROI-based cortical thickness values and cognitive ability scores (Figure 1B-C-D)<br><br>
<i>hcp_parent_script.m:</i> code to perform statistical measures between cortical thickness and fluid intelligence with HCP data (Figure 1E)<br><br>
<i>power_decrease_parent_script.m:</i> code to prove that power estimates for the average method depend on the size of the full sample (Figure 2A)<br><br>
<i>inflation_effect_parent_script.m:</i> code to assess effect size inflation across multiple statistical thresholds (Figure 2B)<br><br>
<i>sample_adjustment_parent_script.m:</i> code to demonstrate that effect sizes reported in the literature align with true effects measured in the population only when the sample size is large enough (Figure 2C)<br><br>
